<p>Idea: Provide answers to some frequently asked questions. Below a first idea for some questions of interest. Some of the Q&amp;A can be taken over from the MCPMod_QA word document. But can add additional questions and some of the answers need updating.</p>
<p>Can we create the html so that all the questions are shown and the answers only if you click on the question?</p>

Refer to sample size Rmd on evaluating power loss in case a model was mis-specified (using powMCT function with alternative models different from those used to define the candidate models).</p>
<p>Some text that could be used here…</p>
<hr />
<p>From interal MCP-Mod guidance: This section deals with selection of the model classes (Emax, exponential, etc) but also with selection of the guesstimates for the model parameters within the model class. Note that guesstimates are needed for the MCP step of the MCP-Mod methodology (to derive the optimal contrasts), but are not utilized in the Mod part. As a rule of thumb, typically a set of 3-7 dose-response shapes (here a dose-response shape refers to the combination of dose-response model and guesstimate) corresponding to 2-4 dose-response models are appropriate. So that multiple dose-response shapes (parameter guesstimates) might be used for each dose-response model. For large uncertainty at the design stage a broad candidate set should be used, while in other situations a more narrow candidate set of models is appropriate. Below we provide a list of considerations to take into account when setting up the candidate set of models</p>
<p>• Existing information o Information might be available on the dose-response curve for a similar compound in the same indication or the same compound in a different indication.</p>
<p>o A dose-exposure-response (PK/PD) model might have been developed based on earlier data (e.g. data from the PoC study). This can be used to predict the dose-response curve at a specific time-point.</p>
<p>• Note that if substantial prior knowledge about the dose-response model is available and there is a sufficient number of doses, the candidate set could consist of only one dose-response model (such as the four-parameter sigmoid Emax model) that is flexible enough to cover a variety of different dose-response shapes at the MCP step. General experience suggests that an Emax type model should always be included in the candidate set of models. A meta-analysis of the dose-response curves for small molecules developed in the past few years at Pfizer showed, that in many situations the monotonic Emax model, or the sigmoid Emax model is able to describe the data adequately (see Thomas et al. 2015).</p>
<p>• Statistical considerations o Model fitting: If only a few active doses are feasible to be used in a trial, it is difficult to fit the more complex models, such as the sigmoid Emax or the beta model with four parameters in a trial with three active doses. Such models would not be included in the candidate set and one would rather use more dose-response models with fewer parameters to obtain an adequate breadth of the candidate set.</p>
<p>o Consequence of model misspecification: Omission of the “correct” dose-response shape from the set of candidate models does not necessarily have severe consequences, if other models can pick up the omitted shape. This can be evaluated for the MCP part (impact on power) using explicit calculations (see Pinheiro et al. (2006)) and for the Mod part (impact on estimation precision for dose-response and dose estimation) using simulations and the DoseFinding R package.</p>
<p>o Impact on sample size: Using a very broad and flexible set of candidate models does not come “for free”. Generally the critical value for the MCP test will increase, in particular if many different candidate shapes are included, and consequently also the sample size. The actual impact will have to be investigated on a case-by-case basis. A similar trade-off exists in terms of dose-response model fitting, as a broader candidate set will decrease potential bias (in the case of a mis-specified model) but increase the variance of the estimates.</p>
<p>o Umbrella-shaped dose-response curve: While biological exposure-response relationships are often monotonic, down-turns of the clinical dose-response relationship at higher doses have been observed. For example if due to adverse events more patients will discontinue treatment with higher doses of the drug, this might lead to a decrease in clinical efficacy at higher doses. If a treatment policy or composite estimand stratey is used for treatment discontinuation. We recommend to consider the inclusion of an umbrella-shaped dose-response model in the candidate set, if it is a plausible scenario given the current information (e.g. existing precedence for the compound class or indication, or based on mechanistic considerations).</p>
<p>o Based on simulation studies utilizing the AIC, it has been observed that the linear model (as it has fewest parameters) is often too strongly favored (with the BIC this trend is even stronger), see results in Schorning et al (but also TUDO paper currently under review). The recommendation would be to exclude the linear model usually from the candidate set, the Emax and exponential model (and also the sigmoid Emax model) both can also approximate a linear shape well in the limiting case.</p>
<p>o In case of for example 4 or 3 active doses it is challenging to fit sigmoid Emax (and beta models). One strategy in these situations is to fix the Hill parameter to a given value (for example 3 and/or 5), and then use different sigmoid Emax candidate models with fixed Hill parameter. Model fitting can be performed with the Emax model but with potentiated doses.</p>
<hr />
<p>Candidate models can be setup using these commands. Rule of thumb: 3 - 7 dose response shapes through 2 - 4 models are usually sufficient. The multiple contrast test is quite robust, even if the model is mis-specified. What information to utilize?</p>
